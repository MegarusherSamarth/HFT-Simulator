# HFT-Simulator

A modular, audit-ready **High-Frequency Trading (HFT) Simulator** designed for research, recruiter/panel demos, and secure backend validation.  
This project integrates **C++ latency-critical engines**, **Python strategy prototyping**, and **Jupyter-based research notebooks** into a single reproducible workflow.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **C++ Engine (`cpp_engine/`)**
  - Ultra-low latency order book and matching engine.
  - Modular design with clear separation of concerns.
  - Audit logs and rate-limiting for demo stability.

- **Data Feed (`data_feed/`)**
  - Live Binance tick integration.
  - Synthetic signal injection for guaranteed trade history.
  - Rolling metrics and CSV logging for reproducibility.

- **Python Strategies (`python_strategies/`)**
  - LSTM and RL-based trading strategies.
  - Hybrid outputs (binary + probabilistic).
  - Automated benchmarking with instant reporting.

- **Dashboard (`dashboard/`)**
  - Real-time equity curve visualization.
  - Action distribution plots for recruiter/panel demos.
  - Demo-friendly safeguards (batch processing, throttled output).

- **Notebooks (`notebooks/`)**
  - Publication-quality charts and tables.
  - Research-ready scaffolds for appendices.
  - Automated labeling and threshold testing.

## 📊 Demo Outputs

- **Equity Curve**: Plotted once at end of run for clarity.  
- **Action Distribution**: Histogram of buy/sell/hold decisions.  
- **Audit Logs**: CSV + console logs for reproducibility.  

---

## 🧪 Validation

- Rolling metrics confirm backend stability.  
- Rate-limiting ensures demo safety.  
- CSV logging supports recruiter/panel review and research appendices.
